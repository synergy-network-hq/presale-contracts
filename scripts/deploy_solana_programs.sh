# This script builds and (optionally) deploys all of the Anchorâ€‘based SNRG
# programs to the Solana mainnet.  It iterates through each program in the
# `solana/programs` directory, builds the program artefacts and then
# performs deployment.  You must have the Anchor CLI installed and
# configured with your Solana keypair and network.  The script assumes you
# have already created the `anchor.toml` file at the root of this project
# that defines each program and its corresponding program ID.
#
# To build and deploy, run:
#   ./scripts/deploy_solana_programs.sh
#
# The script uses `anchor build` and `anchor deploy` commands.  If you only
# wish to build without deployment, set the environment variable
# `DEPLOY=false` before executing this script.
