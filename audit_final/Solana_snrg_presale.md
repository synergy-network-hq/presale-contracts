# Audit Findings Report (Re‑evaluated): Solana snrg_presale

**Overview**

This second review of the `snrg_presale` program verifies that no new issues have arisen.  The absence of signature verification was noted previously; the program remains unchanged and should be complemented with off‑chain or on‑chain signature checks for production use.

**Resolved observations**

- None; the design decision to omit signature verification persists.

**Remaining notes**

- Implement signature checks before mainnet deployment.
