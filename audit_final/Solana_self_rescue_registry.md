# Audit Findings Report (Re‑evaluated): Solana self_rescue_registry

**Overview**

The re‑audit of the `self_rescue_registry` program indicates that it continues to function as intended.  Observations about the executor list size and lack of event logging remain but pose no critical risk.

**Resolved observations**

- None.

**Remaining notes**

- Implement limits on the number of executors and consider slot‑based timing for rescues in future iterations.
