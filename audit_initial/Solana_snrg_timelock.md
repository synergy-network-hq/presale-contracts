# Audit Findings Report: Solana snrg_timelock

**Overview**

The Solana `snrg_timelock` program is a minimal implementation that stores a minimum delay and multisig authority.  It does not yet implement queuing or execution of governance actions.  No vulnerabilities were identified.

**High severity issues**

- None.

**Medium severity issues**

- None.

**Low severity issues / Observations**

- Without scheduling logic, the program provides limited functionality beyond storage.  An extended implementation would need to guard against reentrancy and ensure correct delay enforcement.

**Recommendations**

- Expand the program to support queuing and executing instructions after the delay and include rigorous testing.
