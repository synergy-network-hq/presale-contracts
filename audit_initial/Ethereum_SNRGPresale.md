# Audit Findings Report: Ethereum SNRGPresale

**Overview**

A static analysis of the Ethereum `SNRGPresale` contract was performed.  This contract implements the SNRG token presale with off‑chain signature verification and support for native and ERC20 payments.  No high or medium severity vulnerabilities were identified.  Only minor observations and gas optimizations are noted.

**High severity issues**

- None.

**Medium severity issues**

- None.

**Low severity issues / Observations**

- Ensure that the signature verification logic remains compatible with future hardforks.  It currently includes `block.chainid` in the hash for replay protection.
- Consider emitting more granular events to aid in off‑chain accounting.

**Recommendations**

- Continue using OpenZeppelin primitives and keep dependencies up to date.
