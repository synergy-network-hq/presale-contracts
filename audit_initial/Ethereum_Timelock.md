# Audit Findings Report: Ethereum Timelock

**Overview**

The Ethereum `Timelock` contract is a thin wrapper around OpenZeppelin's `TimelockController`.  It assigns the multisig wallet as the sole proposer and admin and relinquishes admin rights from the deployer.  No vulnerabilities were detected.

**High severity issues**

- None.

**Medium severity issues**

- None.

**Low severity issues / Observations**

- Ensure that the multisig address provided during deployment is correct, as it will control administrative functions.
- The deployer must not retain any roles after initialization, which is correctly handled via `renounceRole`.

**Recommendations**

- Periodically audit the timelock configuration to verify that proposer and executor roles are correctly set.
