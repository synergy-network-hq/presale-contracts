# Audit Findings Report: Polygon Timelock

**Overview**

Polygon’s `Timelock` contract wraps OpenZeppelin’s `TimelockController` exactly as on Ethereum.  It delegates proposer and admin roles to the multisig and revokes the deployer’s rights.  No security issues were found.

**High severity issues**

- None.

**Medium severity issues**

- None.

**Low severity issues / Observations**

- Verify that the minimum delay aligns with Polygon’s block times and governance requirements.

**Recommendations**

- Audit role assignments after deployment to ensure no residual permissions remain.
